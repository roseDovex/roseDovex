- 👋 Hi, I’m @roseDovex
- 🍃 I’m interested in ... playing, musics, styles/fashions and so much more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... some other languages
  so i can communicate with others
  and sometimes know what they're saying. And im
  learning some other English words too, because it's
  really hard to understand deep english words for me 😅
